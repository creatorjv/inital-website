    <p>I grew up with a profound interest in technology. First started taking electronics apart just to see if I could put them back togethor and so I could look at the components from within. As I became more comfortable with taking things apart and putting them back togethor I would try to fix things that I knew were broken. Then in high school the website MySpace came out and you were able to tweak for page to have music play for whom ever visited, as well as you could change the pages layout and color themes, backgrounds, etc. This was my first point in my life that I dealt with code (HTML, CSS ? If that was even around back then). As I went through high school like most people interested in technology I became consumed with video games (I still and partly consumed!). Because of this, high school, and a combination of the lack of outlets for a child to continue technology interests in the early 2000's. I didn't really tinker with technology until I graduated. My technology journey resumed in 2007 when the first iphone was released. Shortly after getting one for myself I learned that threw jailbreaking the phoen you could change how the software looked, performed, even install things that weren't available to stock iPhones. Then when I enlisted into the U.S. Marine Corps. The iPhone 4 had been released and I learned that there was a way for you to change the back glass and front glass to be opaque allowing you to forever see the internals of the smartphone. I performed the necessary task to do this and by doing so learned how to perform common repairs (ie: broken screens, battery, replacement, back glass replacement). Over night I became the Marine to go to when your smartphone broke. Upon seperation from the Marine Corps I began my journey in <em>actually</em> persuing a technology career. It didn't last long as many can contest the information is overwhelming at times and it is very easy to get discouaged. I thought I was not smart enough for this I'm horrible at math I'll never make it. So I quite. Then in 2017 I taught myself threw youtube videos how build my own computers and in doing so became the person in the family to repair smartphones and computers. I wasn't until I vacationed to Mexico to meet more of my wife's side of the family that I realized <em>"Hey I really like software engineering"</em>. While in Mexico I repaired/updated am iMac for her uncle his daughter had a career with a company that was provide a service to nike with SQL (I had no idea what SQL was at the time) but she had a bug in her code. From my past technology classes and what I know/understand about hardware I suggested she take a look at her database portion of the code. A day later she told me that my assumption was right! Now I fixed the her fathers comupter because she had no knowledge of hardware but, the fact that I got lucky (yes I think of it more as luck as it was barely an edcuated guess) with her SQL code. I said to myslef <em>Not bad you might have what it takes afterall</em>. Since then I have been trying everything I can to learn and understand the vast knowledge involving <strong>Software Engineering</strong>. I've had my self doubt momments, I'm sure there will be more in the future. But this time I'm sticking with it!</p>
